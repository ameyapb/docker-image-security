Final draft along with Anchore Authomation using Python.

Abstract:

Containerization technology is one of the key pillars of information technology (IT) infrastructure. Docker is widely used due to its mass popularity. Docker as a technology is vulnerable in terms of IT security. This research provides evidence of the same and also provides importance of few best practise's mandatory for implementation. Further there are two experiments performed to which provides a glimpse on dependency of offcial images imported/PULLED from Dockerhub. An architecture is proposed in this research which provides an extra layer of security pre deployments of any images. Anchore Engine is the backbone of the proposed architecture. A complete analysis on the Docker images on Dockerhub is provided along with evidence. Hundred random images are tested on the proposed architerture where fifty of them are ofcial images from Dockerhub and rest fifty are the non-veried ones. A live privilege escalation attack has been performed where an Ubuntu local host is exploited on the basis of miscongurations. Towards the end of the research, security efficiency of docker as a technology is provided on the basis of the experiments conducted.
